                <h3>Who Are The Lumineers...?</h3>

            <p>The Lumineers are an American <em>folk rock</em> band based in Denver, Colorado. The founding members are Wesley Schultz (lead vocalist, guitar) and Jeremiah Fraites (drums, percussion, piano). Schulz and Fraites began writing and performing together in Ramsey, New Jersey in 2005. Cellist and vocalist Neyla Pekarek (cello) joined the band in 2010, and was a member until 2018. They specialise in folk rock also termed as <span class="word">Americana</span> genre of music. Their striped back raw sound is what endears them most to me. It is a very infectious sound with quite <strong>thoughtful</strong> lyrics.</p>
